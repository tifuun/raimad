    abstract = {Quantum technologies, such as communication, computing, and sensing, offer vast opportunities for advanced research and development. While an open-source ethos currently exists within some quantum technologies, especially in quantum computer programming, we argue that there are additional advantages in developing open quantum hardware (OQH). Open quantum hardware encompasses open-source software for the control of quantum devices in labs, blueprints, and open-source toolkits for chip design and other hardware components, as well as openly accessible testbeds and facilities that allow cloud-access to a wider scientific community. We provide an overview of current projects in the OQH ecosystem, identify gaps, and make recommendations on how to close them at present. More open quantum hardware would accelerate technology transfer to and growth of the quantum industry and increase accessibility in science.},
